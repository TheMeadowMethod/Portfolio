  <p>
Welcome to The Meadow Method

A quiet corner of the internet where code meets craft — where handmade stitches and elegant websites grow side by side like wildflowers.

I’m Merel — an amateur web developer, hobby level fiber artist, and lover of mossy mornings, ginger cats, and cottagecore comforts.

The Meadow Method is more than just a name — it’s the way I move through the world: slowly, gently, and creatively. It’s how I express myself while navigating the rhythms of ADHD and fibromyalgia.
This space is part studio, part sanctuary — a soft place to land and to grow.
Here you’ll find my projects, my process, and the little joys that help me heal.

Pour yourself something warm and stay a while.
