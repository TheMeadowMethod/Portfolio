<h3>About</h3>
<p>
Welcome to The Meadow Method
<br>
A quiet corner of the internet where code meets craft, where handmade stitches and elegant websites grow side by side like wildflowers.
<br>
I&apos;m Merel, an amateur web developer, hobby level fiber artist, and lover of mossy mornings, ginger cats, and
cottagecore comforts.
<br>
The Meadow Method is more than just a name, it&apos;s the way I move through the world: slowly, gently, and
creatively. It&apos;s how I express myself while navigating the rhythms of ADHD and fibromyalgia.
This space is part studio, part sanctuary, a soft place to land and to grow.
Here you&apos;ll find my projects, my process, and the little joys that help me heal.
<br>
Get yourself cosy and stay a while.
