## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>
  My name is Merel(she/her), the person behind The Meadow Method. 
  Recently I've been struggling a lot with both physical and mental healt. Not being able to go to work when you're 28 really makes you question your life choices ^^. 
  The Meadow Method will be my cosy corner of the internet where I share all my crafts (both digital and handmade) on my journey through life.
