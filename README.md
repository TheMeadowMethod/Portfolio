## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>
  My name is Merel(she/her), the person behind The Meadow Method. 
  Recently I've been struggling a lot with both physical and mental health lately. Not being able to go to work when you're 28 really makes you question your life choices ^^. 
  The Meadow Method will be my cosy corner of the internet where I share all my crafts (both digital and handmade) on my (healing) journey through life.

  Feel free to reach out to me on social media if you want to talk about cats, coffee and all things cosy!
